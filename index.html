        One of the reasons why I love Iron Man so much is because he is one of the few members of the Avengers who has no superpowers. This makes him incredibly unique when it comes to superheroes in general. While Stan Lee’s famous quote says, “With power comes great responsibility,” what it should say is, “With no power, comes even more responsibility.” Iron Man has a lot of pressure on him to save lives when he can’t depend on any superhuman capabilities. All he can depend on is his Iron Man suit to help him fly, his strength through battles that ordinary people wouldn't be able to handle, and a fearless nature when facing the many who would try to harm him, his loved ones, or the world at large.
